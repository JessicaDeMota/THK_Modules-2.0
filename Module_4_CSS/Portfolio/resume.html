            <p class ="desc">Thanks to Break Through Tech New York, I was selected by IBM 
                to do a Winternship. While at my time, at IBM, I worked with a diverse group of females
                to tackle several problems. I researched companies with innovative data and analytic 
                solutions for the new IBM service, Cloud Pak for Data. Further on, I was able to build
                an algorithim for finding partners by using Python and Java to come up with an algorithim.
                Lastly, I learned about one of the most interesting innovative partners IBM has which is known as 
                P-Tech. With P-Tech, I created a mock boot camp for P-Tech, to allow students to get an introduction 
                in the tech world by solving solutions with adhere companies.
