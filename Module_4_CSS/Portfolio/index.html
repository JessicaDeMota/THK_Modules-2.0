            <p>It all started when I was born 6 days before 9/11. My life went on a crazy journey, as 
                my immigrant parents consistently moderated my health and watched what was next. From that journey, 
                on I watched myself take on roles in which I saw myself wanting to be someone on a stage performing 
                Beyonce songs and then being someone who danced like Ciera during the VMA's. I took my arguments with 
                strong points, the second I realized YouTube can educate me and was named "la abogoda" by my mother 
                in the household. With all this long journey, I realized I like to defend, fight, and make a change 
                publicly leading me to my career in tech.
